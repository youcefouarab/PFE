      This is the default (root) TOSCA Artifact Type definition that all other TOSCA base Artifact
      Types derive from.

  tosca.artifacts.File:
    metadata:

      specification.citation: '[TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3]'
      specification.location: 5.4.2
    description: >-
      This artifact type is used when an artifact definition needs to have its associated file
      simply treated as a file and no special handling/handlers are invoked (i.e., it is not treated
      as either an implementation or deployment artifact type).

      This artifact type represents the parent type for all deployment artifacts in TOSCA. This
      class of artifacts typically represents a binary packaging of an application or service that
      is used to install/create or deploy it as part of a node's lifecycle.

    description: >-
      This artifact type represents a parent type for any "image" which is an opaque packaging of a
      TOSCA Node's deployment (whether real or virtual) whose contents are typically already
      installed and pre-configured (i.e., "stateful") and prepared to be run on a known target
      container.

      specification.location: 5.4.3.4
    description: >-
      This artifact represents the parent type for all Virtual Machine (VM) image and container
      formatted deployment artifacts. These images contain a stateful capture of a machine (e.g.,
      server) including operating system and installed software along with any configurations and
      can be run on another machine using a hypervisor which virtualizes typical server (i.e.,
      hardware) resources.

    description: >-
      This artifact type represents the parent type for all implementation artifacts in TOSCA. These
      artifacts are used to implement operations of TOSCA interfaces either directly (e.g., scripts)
      or indirectly (e.g., config. files).

      This artifact type represents a Bash script type that contains Bash commands that can be
      executed on the Unix Bash shell.

  tosca.artifacts.template:
    metadata:
      tosca.normative: 'true'

      specification.location: 5.4.5.1
    description: >-
        This artifact type represents the parent type for all template type artifacts in TOSCA. This
        class of artifacts typically represent template files that are dependent artifacts for
        implementation of an interface or deployment of a node.

        Like the case of other dependent artifacts, the TOSCA orchestrator copies the dependent
        artifacts to the same location as the primary artifact for its access during execution.
        However, the template artifact processor need not be deployed in the environment where the
        primary artifact executes.  At run time, the Orchestrator can invoke the artifact processor
        (i.e. template engine) to fill in run time values and provide the “filled template” to the
        primary artifact processor for further processing. 

        This reduces the requirements on the primary artifact target environment and the processing
        time of template artifacts.
