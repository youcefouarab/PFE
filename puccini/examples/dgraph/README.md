Dgraph Example
--------------

[Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/) natively uses a variation of the
[RDF N-Quads format](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/), however it also supports
[JSON for mutations](https://dgraph.io/docs/mutations/json-mutation-format/), which is easier
for us to work with in JavaScript.

You can visualize your results using Ratel, Dgraph's web GUI, at
[`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/).
