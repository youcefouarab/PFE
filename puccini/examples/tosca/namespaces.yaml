imports:

# The short notation of import merges the names into this namespace
- imports/nginx.yaml

# Use the long notation of import to specify "namespace_prefix" 
- namespace_prefix: mongodb
  file: imports/mongodb.yaml

# The optional "namespace" keyword specifies the canonical namespace for the types declared here
# (In Puccini it appears only in the compiled Clout output with a "::" separator)
# It is typically used when designing type profiles
# In this file it does nothing, because we do not declare types here
# But see its use in "imports/nginx.yaml" and "imports/mongodb.yaml"
