      The TOSCA Artifact Type all other TOSCA Artifact Types derive
      from

  File:
    derived_from: Root
    description: >
      This artifact type is used when an artifact definition needs to
      have its associated file simply treated as a file and no special
      handling/handlers are invoked.

      TOSCA base type for deployment artifacts

  Deployment.Image:
    derived_from: Deployment
    description: >
      This artifact type represents a parent type for any “image”
      which is an opaque packaging of a TOSCA Node’s deployment
      (whether real or virtual) whose contents are typically already
      installed and pre-configured (i.e., “stateful”) and prepared to
      be run on a known target container.

  Deployment.Image.VM:
    derived_from: Deployment.Image
    description: >
      This artifact represents the parent type for all Virtual Machine
      (VM) image and container formatted deployment artifacts.  These
      images contain a stateful capture of a machine (e.g., server)
      including operating system and installed software along with any
      configurations and can be run on another machine using a
      hypervisor which virtualizes typical server (i.e., hardware)
      resources.  Virtual Machine (VM) Image
